## Feature Engineering

The data set required significant preprocessing and feature engineering. Following several layers of preprocessing and engineering, including: transforming categorical features into numeric one, encoding large-set categorical features, removing class imbalance, removing null values, etc., the finalized dataset contains 81 features and 189,019 rows (see feature descriptions below).
